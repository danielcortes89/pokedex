# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 npm install

In order to install dependencies. Then in the main directory run:

 npm start

 ## For Version 2

 In the future, I'd like to add: 
 
 - the other pokemon regions
 - More details on each pokemon
 - Decorations for making site look more like a Pokedex.
